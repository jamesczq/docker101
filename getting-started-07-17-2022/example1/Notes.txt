Dockerfile is a manifest/blue for building Images

An image is a template for instantiating a Container

docker -v 

docker build -t my-python-imdb . 
# it's easy to forget the "." above, which means to write the Image to 
# the current dir in the docker container

docker run -i -t my-python-imdb 
# -i: interactive
# -t: open up a pseudo terminal
